Try a CSS Tutorial Readme:

After a lot of searching I managed to find an article that 

was not full of SCSS, javascript and other more advanced 

methods of web design. I found an article on using CSS 

counters in helpful ways. I was immedately drawn to this 

article since it is similar to what I am learning in 

fundmentals of programming. The article is a blog post not 

older than two years as per instructions.

I liked that the article was familiar in some ways to what 

I am learning in another class at the moment. I did not 

use anything other than the first part of the article 

because the second part used HAML which I know nothing 

about and two because the rest of the article held no real 

value to me at the moment as it becomes overly advanced 

for my current skill level. The first part of the article 

the 'basic counter' was built upon many of the techniques 

we have learned in the previous chapters from relative 

hyperlinks to box shadow and background color. It 

introduced several new concepts and elements such as the 

section element, the before content and of course 

counters. The :hover features caught my attention once I 

figured out what it was used for. 

I think the main reason this article was useful to me was 

due to the fact that I had to figure out the function of 

things I'd never seen in class such as overflow, :hover 

and float by playing around with the dev tools. The html 

that I'm submitting isn't all that different from what is 

in the article but what I was trying to show that I had 

learned was how to use the hover feature for relative 

hyperlinks. It looks flashier and I could see myself using 

it for a photo album part of a webpage.
